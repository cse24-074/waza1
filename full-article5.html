    <h2>Two goals from Hinshelwood, plus O'Riley and Gomez strikes, were not enough to earn Conference League football</h2>

       <p> Brighton & Hove Albion missed out on UEFA Conference League qualification, despite Jack Hinshelwood's double inspiring a 4-1 comeback win at Tottenham Hotspur on the final day.</p>

   <p>Spurs supporters put on a show to welcome home the UEFA Europa League champions, and they soon had further reason to celebrate when Dominic Solanke opened the scoring with a 17th-minute penalty after Mats Wieffer's foul on Mathys Tel.</p>

<p>However, Hinshelwood – who scored Brighton's winner last time out against Liverpool – restored parity six minutes into the second half before reacting fastest again with an inventive finish to send Brighton ahead in the 64th minute.</p>

<p>A late penalty by Matt O'Riley and Diego Gomez's thumping finish wrapped up an impressive turnaround as Fabian Hurzeler's side sealed eighth place – but Chelsea's 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest meant Brighton could not sneak into the Conference League.</p>

</p>Spurs, meanwhile, ended a drab domestic campaign in disappointing fashion, but will still be playing Champions League football next season, despite their 17th-placed finish in the Premier League.</p>
