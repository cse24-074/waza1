    <h2>Ben Bloom reflects on the last 10 matches of an enthralling 2024/25 Premier League season</h2>
    <p class="article-meta">Published on May 25, 2025 by Ben Bloom</p>

    <div class="article-body">
        On the final day of the season, Chelsea beat Nottingham Forest to secure UEFA Champions League football, while defeat for Aston Villa at Manchester United meant they missed out.

<p>That Old Trafford loss was sufficient for Newcastle United to finish fifth, despite a surprise home defeat for Eddie Howe’s side against Everton.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton suffered record-breaking defeats, while Manchester City secured third place.<p>
<p>An Antoine Semenyo double defeated already-relegated Leicester City to complete a record-breaking season for AFC Bournemouth.<p>

<p>The comprehensive final-day victory meant Andoni Iraola’s side set club-best records for fewest goals conceded (46), most goals scored (58), most wins (15) and most points (56) in a single Premier League campaign.<p>

<p>With seven shots on target in this match, they also had more than 200 for the first time in the competition (202 in total).<p>

<p>Leicester, meanwhile, return to the Championship after 25 defeats – their joint-worst tally of losses in a season (alongside 1994/95 and 1977/78).<p>

<p>The visitors did not manage a single effort on target – the third time they have failed to do so in a Premier League game this season. No team did so more often in the competition.<p>

<p>Ending the season in typical strong Pep Guardiola fashion, City eased past Fulham to extend their unbeaten Premier League run to 10 games to secure third spot.<p>

<p>A brilliant Ilkay Gundogan bicycle kick meant the German maintained his record of scoring in each of his eight league campaigns with City. Erling Haaland then added a second from the penalty spot.

Victory was City’s 15th successive league triumph over Fulham – the outright longest winning run one club have recorded over another in the history of England’s top four tiers (overtaking Man City’s record v Bournemouth).

Despite guaranteeing UEFA Champions League football next season, this is only the second time a Guardiola team has finished outside of the top two in his 16 seasons as a top-flight manager. The other was in the 2016/17 Premier League campaign when City also finished third.

The match was only the third in Premier League history not to feature an English player in either of the starting XIs, after Portsmouth v Arsenal in December 2009 and Arsenal v Chelsea in January 2019.</p>
