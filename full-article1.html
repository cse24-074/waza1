    <h2>All you need to know as Premier League clubs try to secure UEFA Champions League, Europa League or Conference League football.</h2>
    <p class="article-meta">Published on May 25, 2025 by Premier League Desk</p>

    <div class="article-body">
    <p> On the final day of the season, five teams will battle for the three remaining places in next season's UEFA Champions League. Here, football writer Alex Keble assesses the contenders - Manchester City, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest - and their fixtures.</p>

<p>The Premier League has never seen a final day quite like this. </p>

<p>We’ve had to-the-wire battles for Champions League places before, but only ever between two clubs fighting for the final spot.  </p>

<p>This season FIVE teams, competing for three spots, are separated by just three points, setting us up for an unprecedented afternoon of twists and turns. It’ll be agonising for fans of the clubs involved, and gripping entertainment for the rest of us.</p> 

<p>All five clubs see Champions League qualification as essential. Two of them won’t make it and, unless Chelsea finish sixth and win the UEFA Conference League on 28 May, one will even miss out on UEFA Europa League football. 

Man City and Newcastle will expect to win their respective matches against Fulham and Everton and secure their spots in the top five. They are both clear favourites, which would leave one place for the winner of the final-day meeting between Nottingham Forest and Chelsea – or Aston Villa, if they can sneak above both of those sides. 

But on a day of nervous football and a chaotic live table, frankly anything could happen. </p>
